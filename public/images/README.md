## Image Guidelines

- Use high-quality, professional images that represent the company's brand and values
- Optimize images for web use (compress them to reduce file size)
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios and styles across images
- Consider using a color filter or overlay on images to maintain brand consistency
- If you don't have actual photos, use appropriate stock images until you can replace them

For best performance, compress all images before deploying the website.
